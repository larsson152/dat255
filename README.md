Vision

The vision of our project is to develop a "Chips Challenge"-esque puzzle game. The objective of the game is to move
inside a grid-based world and solve puzzles to advance to new levels.

Features
=====
-Grid-based

-Special Tiles (e.g. Ice tiles that makes the character slides until he collides with a new object, fire tiles that kills
the character and door tiles that can only be traversed if the character has picked up the matching key to open the door.
-2D Graphics
-Sound
-High Score
