Vision for project "Wood"
=========================

This android application is for people at all ages that want an easy to pick
up game, that is well suited for both short sessions and longer sessions.
Project "Wood" is a puzzle game that is addicting, challenging, brainteasing 
and easy to learn. Unlike Chip's Challenge, which is our main competitor,
our product is tailored for mobile devices with new elements, features, level
and graphic design and more improvements.
