User stories for project "Wood"
================================

- As a user I would like an easy to play game, without the need of reading instructions.  

- As a user I would like a highscore list and a unique username, so that others can see how well I did in the game. 

- As a user I would like music and sound effects when I play to enhance the gaming experience.

- I would like to be able to move the character with an in-game D-pad, because a D-pad is more precise than swipe controls.

- To further improve the gaming experience I would as a user like to have a customizeable character, e.g. special shoes that allows me to walk on water, or a flammable suit that makes me immune to fire.

- As a user I would like to be a able to choose between a number of different levels to increase the time you can play.
